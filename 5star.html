                5 Star is a chocolate bar produced by Cadbury's and sold in India, Indonesia, Malaysia, Brazil, South Africa, the Philippines and Egypt.[1][2] It is described as a "caramel and nougat" mix covered with 
                "smooth milk chocolate" and is sold in a golden wrapper decorated with stars.
                5 Star was launched in India in 1969.[4][5] In 2016 it was launched in Malaysia and the Philippines in 15g 'mini-bars', 45g standard bars and 150g sharepacks (of 10 mini-bars).[5] It was launched in Brazil the same year but under Cadbury's sister brand Lacta.[1]
                5 Star has also been widely distributed in South Africa since 2017 as a replacement for 
                the defunct Tempo bar.
                In 2019, 5 Star was released in UK shops and supermarkets for a limited time only
