        Perk is a combination of crisp wafer and delicious Cadbury chocolate
        that enlivens your mood and sparks the lighter side of life.Cadbury,
        formerly Cadbury's and Cadbury Schweppes, is a British multinational
        confectionery company wholly owned by Mondelez International (originally
        Kraft Foods) since 2010. It is the second largest confectionery brand in
        the world after Mars.[2] Cadbury is internationally headquartered in
        Uxbridge, west London, and operates in more than 50 countries worldwide.
        It is known for its Dairy Milk chocolate, the Creme Egg and Roses
        selection box, and many other confectionery products. One of the
        best-known British brands, in 2013 The Daily Telegraph named Cadbury
        among Britain's most successful exports.[3] Cadbury was established in
        Birmingham, England in 1824, by John Cadbury who sold tea, coffee and
        drinking chocolate. Cadbury developed the business with his brother
        Benjamin, followed by his sons Richard and George. George developed the
        Bournville estate, a model village designed to give the company's
        workers improved living conditions. Dairy Milk chocolate, introduced in
        1905, used a higher proportion of milk within the recipe compared with
        rival products. By 1914, the chocolate was the company's best-selling
        product. Cadbury, alongside Rowntree's and Fry's, were the big three
        British confectionery manufacturers throughout much of the 19th and 20th
        centuries.[4] Cadbury was granted its first Royal Warrant from Queen
        Victoria in 1854. It has been a holder of a Royal Warrant from Elizabeth
        II since 1955.[5] Cadbury merged with J. S. Fry & Sons in 1919, and
        Schweppes in 1969, known as Cadbury Schweppes until 2008, when the
        American beverage business was split as Dr Pepper Snapple Group; the
        rights ownership of the Schweppes brand had already differed between
        various countries since 2006. Cadbury was a constant constituent of the
        FTSE 100 on the London Stock Exchange from the index's 1984 inception
        until the company was bought by Kraft Foods in 2010.
