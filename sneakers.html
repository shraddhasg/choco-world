            <p>Snickers is a brand name chocolate bar made by the American company Mars, Incorporated, 
                consisting of nougat topped with caramel and peanuts that has been enrobed in milk chocolate.
                [2] The annual global sales of Snickers was $2 billion as of 2004.[3]
                In the United Kingdom, the Isle of Man, Jersey, Guernsey and Ireland, Snickers was sold under 
                the brand name Marathon until July 19, 1990.[4] Snickers-brand Marathon energy bars have since been sold in some markets.

            <h3>Snickers Duo</h3>
            <p>A replacement for the king size Snickers bar was launched in the UK in 2004, and designed to conform 
                to the September 2004 Food and Drink Federation (FDF) "Manifesto for Food and Health". Part of the FDF 
                manifesto was seven pledges of action to encourage the food and drink industry to be more health conscious.[8] Reducing portion size, clearer food labels, and reduction of the levels of fat, sugar, and salt were among the FDF pledges. Mars Incorporated pledged to phase out their king-size bars in 2005 and replace them with shareable bars. A Mars spokesman said: "Our king-size bars that come in one portion will be changed so they are shareable or can be consumed on more than one occasion. The name king-size will be phased out."[8]
                These were eventually replaced by the 'Duo' - a double bar pack. Though this change to Duos reduced the weight from 3.5 to 3.29 ounces (99 to 93 g), the price remained the same. The packaging has step-by-step picture instructions of how to open a Duo into two bars, in four simple actions.[9] As Mars stated fulfillment of their promise, the Duo format was met with criticism by the National Obesity Forum and National Consumer Council.
